--- Performance Metrics and ML Results ---
Pipeline fitting duration: 4.60 seconds
Data transformation + prediction duration: 0.61 seconds
Actual vocabulary size (after preprocessing): 31355 unique terms
HashingTF numFeatures set to: 20000
Classification Accuracy (Training Data): 1.0000
Note: numFeatures (20000) is smaller than actual vocabulary size (31355). Hash collisions are expected.
