Data reading duration: 1.97 seconds
Pipeline fitting duration: 1.82 seconds
Data transformation duration: 0.75 seconds
Vocabulary size calculation duration: 0.45 seconds
Cosine similarity calculation duration: 0.40 seconds
Actual vocabulary size (after preprocessing): 31355 unique terms
HashingTF numFeatures set to: 20000
Note: numFeatures (20000) is smaller than actual vocabulary size (31355). Hash collisions are expected.
